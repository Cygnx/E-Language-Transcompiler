# Recursive-Descent-parser
Recursive Descent parser for the Language E
Language : Java
Description: This program takes a program written in the language E, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_%28programming_language%29, and translates it into a semantically equivalent C program. The parsing is done using a Recursive decent approach. 

I worked on this project so that I could better understand the parsing and compiling proccess of a compiler.
